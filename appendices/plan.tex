\section{Work Schedule for DP1}
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|}
\hline
week 1     & planning and outlining the work, researching the topic  \\
\hline
week 2-3     & writing about UML and the class diagram \\
\hline
week 4-5     & research and writing about e-learning \\
\hline
week 6-8      & researching the applications of e-learning to the class diagram  \\
\hline
week 9-10   & writing about e-learning's applications to the class diagram  \\
\hline
week 11-12   & proposing our approach to the rest of the project \\

\paragraph{Statement on the execution of the plan:} 

The purpose of DP1 was to research the topic of the project. At the beginning of the semester, exploration of \ac{uml} and e-learning was carried out. We described the basic concepts of the class diagram. The subsequent topics were drawn out, however. We got delayed at research about e-learning and its applications on \ac{uml}, and had to compensate for the lost time during the exam period. 

% The purpose of BP1 was to research the topic of the project. At the beginning of the semester, exploration of ML and autoML was carried out, and the plan for the time period was drawn out. In the second half of the semester, the plan was to start describing the theoretical concepts needed for the project. The basics of ML and autoML were to be researched and described. By the end of the first semester, the first two chapters were supposed to be finished. The plan was followed until week 10. We got delayed at that point, and had to compensate for the lost time during the exam period.

\section{Work Schedule for DP2}
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|}
\hline
week 1     & research about various \ac{lms}  \\
\hline
week 2-3     & familiarizing with Moodle \ac{lms} \\
\hline
week 4-6     & implementing the theoretical sections of the course \\
\hline
week 7-11      & implementing the concepts of the exercises in the course  \\
\hline
week 12   & writing the design and implementation chapters  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Statement on the execution of the plan:} 

The goal for DP2 was to implement the course. The intentions were not completely fulfilled, as we still have a number of tasks left, namely creating more exercises, implementing gamification and social learning. We did create a draft of the course as well as drafts for all the exercise types we want to use.

\section{Work Schedule for DP3}
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|}
\hline
week 1-2     &  implementing gamification and social learning practices  \\
\hline
week 3-4     & finishing creating additional exercises \\
\hline
week 5     & deployment of the course on a private \ac{fiit} server \\
\hline
week 6-10      & performing experiments on students and evaluating them  \\
\hline
week 10-12   & finish writing the text for the thesis  \\

% 3rd semester plan:
% -implement gamification, social learning
% -write some sections (deployment, deviations, describe impl of gamification and such)
% -optional: embed draw.io and do some workaround - such as show results without autocorrection, or implement a very basic corrector where just adding relationships to a mostly premade diagram or something basic would be done
% 	-that would be nice for the theory section - make it yourself, then it shows how it should be done
% -experiments and eval
% -deploy
