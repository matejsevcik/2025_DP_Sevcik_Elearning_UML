\paragraph{Statement on the execution of the plan:} 

The purpose of DP1 was to research the topic of the project. At the beginning of the semester, exploration of \ac{uml} and e-learning was carried out. We described the basic concepts of the class diagram. The subsequent topics were drawn out, however. We got delayed at research about e-learning and its applications on \ac{uml}, and had to compensate for the lost time during the exam period. 

% The purpose of BP1 was to research the topic of the project. At the beginning of the semester, exploration of ML and autoML was carried out, and the plan for the time period was drawn out. In the second half of the semester, the plan was to start describing the theoretical concepts needed for the project. The basics of ML and autoML were to be researched and described. By the end of the first semester, the first two chapters were supposed to be finished. The plan was followed until week 10. We got delayed at that point, and had to compensate for the lost time during the exam period.

% \paragraph{Statement on the execution of the plan:} 

% Since the theoretical part of the project was completed during the first semester, the goal of the second semester was to conduct and evaluate our experiments. At the start of the semester, we familiarized ourselves with the chosen autoML tools and found datasets suitable for the experiments. Then, the experiments were carried out. The end of the semester was reserved for evaluating the experiments and finishing the documentation. The plan was followed reasonably well, although the experiments took longer than expected at the expense of time allocated to writing the documentation.
